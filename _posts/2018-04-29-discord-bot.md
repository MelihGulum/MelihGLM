## Explanation the Project

When I was doing my internship at AdresGezgini, we used scrum methodology. Every day, their roles would change and we would try to gain experience in all of them. However, sometimes the pursuit of this can be annoying. We could forget or misremember. I made a simple discord bot to avoid this.

I wrote some commands by specifying keywords. For example, when we type "/scrum", the links that we follow scrum come up. And if we type "/duty", we could see our tasks for that day.
