## Explanation the Project

<p>This project is actually a continuation of our other project, <a href="https://semihstp.github.io//teeth_numbering_and_disease_detection/">tooth numbering and disease diagnosis in adults</a>. After the semester, we wanted the project to be aimed at children, in order to expand the scope of the project. However, a child and an adult mouth are very different from each other. Therefore, we have started the project in a way with the creation of a new data set and the addition of new enumerations and new diseases. For example, the numbering for the adult individual is between 11-48 but 11-85 for the child. Again, we have two different model. </p>

This project has become a more challenging for us as the number of classes has increased.In this project, we set a data limit of at least 7000 labeled image, but we are currently on 4000 x-rays. Although we have not been able to give the final version of the project, I will keep this updated over time and convey the information to you fresh.

Tooth numbering in children in addition to adults:
